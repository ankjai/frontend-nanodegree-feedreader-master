## Jasmine Testing Project


#### Running project

###### Open html in browser
Open index.html (present at project level) file directly in the browser.

###### Using Python SimpleHTTPServer
The simplest way is to use `SimpleHTTPServer` if you already have Python installed.

Python comes already installed on most Mac OS X and Linux computers. In a terminal window, change to the directory that has your HTML files and run the following command:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
After it starts, you can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html
